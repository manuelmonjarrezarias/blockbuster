# Blockbuster
#### JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas game

### Gameplay

The objective of the game is to control a ball (your player) and shoot falling blocks without them touching you. Every block you destroy will award you some points. Blocks are of different speeds, shapes, colours, sizes and strength and even move in different directions. Points will be given according to the type of block destroyed. Your ammo is limited, but a single bullet is returned to you if you successfully destroy a block.
